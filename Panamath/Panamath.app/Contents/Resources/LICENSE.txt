Panamath GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
last updated May 4, 2011

Preamble

The Panamath General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share the Panamath software, free of charge. This General Public License applies to all. You can use this license on all computers in your laboratory or group. Circulation to individuals or groups outside of your own is not advisable. Sharing the software executable or your personal license key in any public forum is prohibited.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that prohibit anyone from denying you these rights or from asking you to surrender them. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities pertaining to the distribution and modification of this software.

We protect your rights with two steps:
(1) by copyrighting the software, and
(2) by offering this license, which gives you the legal permission to copy and distribute the software among your group.

Because the present version of Panamath is free, we do not provide a warranty for the software. Some portions of the software, however, are patent-protected. Hence, copying of the software requires proper citation.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice, placed by the copyright holder, saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program," below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it--either verbatim, with modifications, and/or translated into another language.

Activities other than copying and distribution are not covered by this License. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program, independent of having been made by running the Program.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's executable among your group as you receive it in any medium. Each copy, however, must include a visible and appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, with no change to any notices referring to this License or the absence of any warranty. Any of the Program's recipients outside of your group must also be provided with a copy of this License.

You may not modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it.

You may obtain additional copies of the software, each with its own unique license, by contacting Panamath.

All Sesame Street characters, images, and names included in Panamath are licensed from Sesame Workshop for use only in Panamath and copying the images is forbidden. Sesame Street character names listed under the "Kids Characters" advanced option panel are trademarks of Sesame Workshop.

NO WARRANTY

Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We are not liable for any risks concerning the quality and performance of the program. You may contact us, however, for technical support.
